# Emotion Detection through Voice

## Overview
This project detects emotions from voice recordings using a deep learning model trained on the TESS dataset. The system processes both recorded and uploaded voice files and classifies emotions.

## Features
- Identifies emotions from voice recordings.
- Supports both uploaded voice files and real-time recordings.
- Works exclusively for female voices and prompts users if an incorrect input is detected.
- User-friendly **GUI** for easy interaction.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd Emotion_Detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the detection system using:
```bash
python emotion_detection.py
```

## Training the Model
1. Place dataset audio files in `dataset/train` and `dataset/val`.
2. Run `model_training.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to train the model.
3. The trained model is saved as `emotion_model.h5`.

## Performance Metrics
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Precision & Recall**
- **Model Accuracy**

## Notes
- Ensure the required audio processing libraries are installed.
- If the model file (`emotion_model.h5`) is too large, upload it to Google Drive and update the link here.
