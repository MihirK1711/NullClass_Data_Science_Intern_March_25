# Drowsiness Detection System

## Overview
This project detects drowsiness in individuals using a deep learning model trained on image datasets. The system identifies multiple people in an image/video, marks sleeping individuals in red, and estimates their age.

## Features
- Detects awake/sleeping individuals in real-time.
- Highlights sleeping individuals in **red**.
- Estimates and displays the **age** of detected individuals.
- Shows a pop-up message with the number and ages of sleeping persons.
- User-friendly **GUI** for real-time detection.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd Drowsiness_Detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the detection system using:
```bash
python drowsiness_detection.py
```

## Training the Model
1. Place dataset images in `dataset/train` and `dataset/val`.
2. Run `model_training.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to train the model.
3. The trained model is saved as `drowsiness_model.h5`.

## Performance Metrics
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Precision & Recall**
- **Model Accuracy**
